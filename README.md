**Exploring the intricate relationship between financial trader performance and prevailing market sentiment through data analysis.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

This repository hosts a data science project focused on analyzing the correlation between trader performance metrics and market sentiment. Utilizing a Jupyter Notebook, the project provides a comprehensive workflow from data loading and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis, correlation calculation, and insightful visualizations. The goal is to uncover potential patterns and dependencies between how traders perform and the general emotional tone of the financial markets.

## ✨ Features

-   **📊 Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Efficient handling and cleaning of raw trader performance and market sentiment datasets.
-   **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth statistical analysis and summary visualizations to understand data distributions and characteristics.
-   **📉 Correlation Analysis:** Quantitative assessment of the relationship between key trader performance indicators and various market sentiment measures.
-   **📈 Interactive Data Visualization:** Creation of plots and charts to visually represent trends, correlations, and anomalies.
-   **💡 Insight Generation:** Derivation of actionable insights regarding the impact of market sentiment on trading outcomes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up the project and run the analysis notebook on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.x**
-   **pip** (Python package installer) or **Conda**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gejendrasharma/Data-science-task.git
    cd Data-science-task
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    Since no `requirements.txt` is provided, we'll install the commonly used data science libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
    ```

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This command will open Jupyter in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8888`.

5.  **Open the analysis notebook**
    From the Jupyter interface, navigate to and open `Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment.ipynb`. You can then run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.
